# Portfolio

### About me :wave:
Hi, my name is Ashikur Jaman Rakib. Since the start of 2023, I have been dedicating myself to studying and practicing to become a QA engineer. I’m thrilled to have found an area where I can grow and succeed. Accessibility is a key focus for me, as I believe it's essential in creating a more inclusive digital world. Through this portfolio, I aim to share my QA knowledge and highlight the practical skills I’ve gained from courses, self-study, and work experience. Currently, I’m focused on advancing my skills in test automation, and I am determined to keep growing in this field.

### My experience :office:
Being a junior software tester at Perfect Gym is my first professional position strictly in QA area. I have made a significant growth both in my tech and soft skills, such as strong analytical thinking and developped some know-how in test automation. In addition, in my previous job, one of my responsibilities was to oversee the correct operation of the internal system and report any bugs or defects to the administrators. I have grown very fond of this role, which has also made me interested in the QA path. My previous experience, although unrelated to the IT world, has allowed me to develop valuable soft skills in particular.
